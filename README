# Dice Roller

### Description
A dice roller application for android devices. Runs the number of dice with the
number of sides of your choosing. Displays the values of each roll as well as
total value of the roll. The number of dice is locked between 1 and 6 while
sides are limited between 3 and 20.

Some difficulties I encountered were input validation and creating a clear and
customized look for the app. I needed to make improper inputs clear for the
more mischievous users. I added a couple methods to familiarize myself. For
number of dice, I limited the keypad to numbers and only enabled numbers 1-6.
For the number of sides I confirm it's in the range of 3 and 20. Both input
boxes display red with empty or invalid input and green when valid.

This is one my first Kotlin experiences. Since I am familiar with Java, it made
the experience more smooth. It helped me better visualize a
model-controller-view design. My only other GUI experience was using JavaFX,
which was helpful.
